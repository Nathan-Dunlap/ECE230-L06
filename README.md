### Lab Summary
This lab taught me how half and full-adders work. It especially helped show how to chain two full-adders in sequence to add more numbers.
### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
If you use two or more full adders in series, you could add as many bits together as you want. 
### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The XOR gate produces the sum bit in binary addition. This is because it will produce a zero if nothing is added or two ones are added, or a one if there is an odd number of inputs (1,0 or 0,1).
### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
A two-bit adder can handle numbers from 0 to 3, with the largest sum it can compute being 6 (110). When the sum exceeds 6, an overflow error occurs.
